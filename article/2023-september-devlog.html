                <h1>Devlog - September 2023</h1>
                <h4>Published on 20 October 2023</h3>
                <a href="../category/project" class="hero-btn2 project">Project News</a>
                <p>In this devlog, you won’t hear as much about the game (sorry for that!). Instead, I’ll mainly write about our Discord server that has recently been undergoing a huge rework that’s almost finished, which you can join <b><a href="https://discord.gg/pyNXGykC2M" target="_blank">here</a></b>.</p>
                <p>Why? It has just been the main focus of ours in September. The rework was essential to align it with our goals, as well as my own goals as a soon-to-debut creator. For context, in the rework we switched the theme by a lot, going for a space that promotes <b>self-improvement and creativity</b> through events, contests, discussion threads, and more - but I’ll talk about it in detail in a later section.</p>
                <p>As it turns out, these themes perfectly align with the idea spread by Spring Poems - the Visual Novel we are working on. See, it’s about an ambitious artist who finds himself needing to overcome himself and improve in order to break through his hurdles. This is why we’re changing the face of our server from the bright and cheerful Aoi - our mascot - to Satoshi, the protagonist of the VN.</p>
                <p>But the theme switch is not everything. There is more: having a custom bot, we have a lot of room to implement all sorts of custom features that you won’t find anywhere else in the same form - a mastery system for participating in productivity events, competitive teams, unique events, and more. To learn more, await our article about the rework that will go in-depth about all the changes in the Discord.</p>
                <p>Now that the server has been discussed, let’s jump to the game progress and spare it a brief mention, although there hasn’t been a lot.</p>
                <h2>Development Progress</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../webimages/september devlog.png">
                    <figcaption>Current stage of development as of October 1, 2023</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The only real change is that the script grew by a few thousand words. Other than that, I reflected on the chapters - how they are structured - and so we might be closer to finishing writing the Common Route than I previously thought. It can be estimated to be at about 60-65% right now, and planning to bump that number up to at least 85% by the end of October.</p>
                <p>To not leave you with empty hands, I’m attaching a finished CG from Chapter 1 that has been drawn a while back by our artists <a href="https://twitter.com/venjuice" target="_blank">ven</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_zehnn" target="_blank">zehnn</a>, whom you should follow on Twitter!</p>

                    <figcaption>Spring Poems Chapter 1 CG</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It depicts Akio, a mysterious poet and the antagonist of the story that will be making a mess in Satoshi’s life. What is his deal? Nobody knows yet…</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for the next devlog at the beginning  of November, hopefully earlier than this one.</p>
